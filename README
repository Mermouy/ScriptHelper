== Welcome to ScriptHelper

ScriptHelper is a POSIC shell library of common functions, to facilitate code reuse.

First, I've wrote ScriptHelper to be able to send bash script to other users and
always know what's wrong when they failed. This was the purpose of the CMD command,
which role is to exec a command, log stdout & stderr, and check the return status.

Then, I've added some functions, I wrote several times.
